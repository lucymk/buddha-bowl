    <h2 class="heading">Spinach</h2>
    <p class="text">
      You can get different types of spinach - the one you get at the
      supermarket in bags is usually baby spinach. It's delicate and you don't
      need to cook it. You can use it raw, or stir it through hot stuff just
      before you eat and it will go a bit softer.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      If you buy a bunch of spinach from the greengrocer, it is more likely to
      be mature spinach! It's a bit tougher and earthier. It can still be eaten
      raw, but you'll probably want to shred it. Otherwise you can stir it
      through hot food as with baby spinach, or

      This is yummy and peppery. Don't cook it, just add it raw at the end - you
      can use it as a topping or make a bed with it üòâ You can also stir through
      hot stuff, like with spinach.

    <h2 class="heading">Mixed leaves or lettuce</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Make a bed or add on the top or side just before you eat, these things
      won't be too good if they get hot ü•µ

    <h2 class="heading">Herbs</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Chop up and add to each bowl you make, it's best not to mix these through too far in advance - they lose their freshness and flavour. Whichever herb it is, just chop it up, and mix through a couple of tablespoons per bowl.
